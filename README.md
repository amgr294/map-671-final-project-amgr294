### Project Background and Purpose

This project aims to visually compare the relationship between housing cost and tree canopy coverage in Seattle, Washington. The hypothesized relationship is that areas with a higher density of tree canopy, demonstrated in increased color density, will be visually associated with areas of higher housing cost, represented by average cost per square foot. Completing this visual analysis will serve to identify if tree canopy density is associated with a higher cost of housing. While many factors influence housing costs, higher tree canopy has been shown to be associated with higher housing price (Lee & Thompson, 2024).

[For more information on the studied relationship between tree canopy and housing price, see this study conducted by Dr. Ryun Lee and Dr. Thomas Thompson.](https://doi.org/10.1080/19498276.2025.2461833)

### Data Sources

The two datasets used in this analysis come from the [Seattle Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/). The first dataset, ["Seattle Tree Canopy 2021"](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::seattle-tree-canopy-2021/about) was used to show the locations of tree canopy across the metropolitan area, mapped in 2021 using remotely sensed data. The second dataset, ["Single-Family Home Sale Prices by Census Tract"](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::single-family-home-sale-prices-by-census-tract/about), was used to show the average price per square foot by census tract. This dataset was specific to single-family homes, meaning the analysis is only applicable to this housing type.
