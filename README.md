### Project Background and Purpose

This project aims to visually compare the relationship between housing cost and tree canopy coverage in Seattle, Washington. The hypothesized relationship is that areas with a higher density of tree canopy, demonstrated in increased color density, will be visually associated with areas of higher housing cost, represented by average cost per square foot. Completing this visual analysis will serve to identify if tree canopy density is associated with a higher cost of housing.
